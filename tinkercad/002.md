# Session 2: 3D planes

In this session, we're going to learn some more advanced 3D software techniques and we're going to learn more about how a 3D printer works.

## How a 3D printer works

Recall: What is the name of the type of manufacturing that we are going to use with our 3D prints?

## What we're doing

For our 3D print, you are each going to make a cube head, which could end up looking like this:

Remember our shape theory? You can have round eyes or square ones, triangles or combinations. You can have a smiling face or a frowning one. A suprised one or a cross one. It's up to you what kind of character you want to create, and what kind of story you might imagine them in.

Now, there are three more tools I want to show you that will come in handy when making your cube face.

### The locking tool

### The scribble tool

### [Tinkercad shape generators list](../tinkercad/tinkercad_shape_generators_list)

## Getting started with our cube heads

Your cube head should be 20mm x 20 mm x 20 mm. And we're all going to start there, and lock it into place.

Let's go!
