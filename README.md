## What is Engineering Your Story?
"Engineering Your Story" is a multiple-session programme for children in Year 3 and up to learn about 3D and computer-aided-design (CAD) technology through imagination.

Engineering Your Story teaches young people to use technology to fuel their imaginations and help them engineer the story of their future, opening them up to careers in character creation, engineering, animation, design, computing and story telling.

Children will start with physical medium like paper, clay and/or 3D pens to experiment with shapes and dimensions. Then they'll use 3D software Tinker CAD to create a character that will be 3D printed for them to take home.

Engineering Your Story was created through a generous grant from the IET and iMechE and is run on a volunteer basis. Local Buckinghamshire schools and organisations can schedule the course on Fridays, where availability permits, and schools farther afield will have a condensed course and need to cover expenses.

## What the Teachers Say
"I was so impressed with how Engineering Your Story taught our children, of all different abilities, and gave them confidence with technology they’d never used before. I especially appreciated how the experience was rooted in creativity and characterisation."

-- Christabel Bunce, Deputy Head at Elmhurst School

"We cannot recommend Engineering Your Story enough! The programme completely energised and inspired the children in our school. They left each session buzzing! One child even said, “I want to do this all day.” The 3D prints that the children created and got to take home were fantastic and the course totally surpassed our expectations. The teachers were helpful, knowledgeable and passionate about the subject."

-- Ed Tang, Deputy Head Teacher, Great Missenden C of E School

"Engineering Your Story delivered a wonderful experience for our SEN children with moderate or complex learning needs. This course was exactly the kind of practical, future-career experiences that Willoughby Academy are determined to offer, and we couldn't believe how well the children were able to work with the 3D software and how much they enjoyed it."

-- Evelyn Cox, Pastoral Manager, Willoughby Academy

## Engineering Education Grant Scheme
Engineering Your Story is possible only because of the generous Engineering Education Grant Scheme from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (theiet.org) and Institution of Mechanical Engineers (imeche.org).

The IET is celebrating 150 years in 2020 and is looking to celebrate and inspire difference makers. I hope Engineering Your Story encourages its participants to go on to make a difference.
