# Session 3: 3D pens drawing 3D

## Make a die with your own words

You'll use placing, resizing, text bars, holes, grouping and a new technique using the workplane.

* Stacking squares template (25 minutes)

This template gives you a precisely measured (see, more maths!) square that you will layer up and then 3D pen eyes and a mouth onto to make a cuboid head.
